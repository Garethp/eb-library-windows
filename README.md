### EB for Windows

This is my copy of EB. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

This copy of EB works (for me). It took me weeks to get it to build. I don't know why it took me so long, but it builds, therefore I am never throwing it away.

To get started:
 * Install Visual Studio
 * Install the "Desktop Development with C++" Workload with the following options
   - Windows 8.1 SDK and UCRT SDK
   - Visual C++ MFC for x86 and x64
 * Open `eb-master/eb.sln`
 * Build (Hopefully)
